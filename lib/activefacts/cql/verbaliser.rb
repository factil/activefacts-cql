    #
    # The Verbaliser fulfils two roles:
    # * Maintains verbalisation context to expand readings using subscripting where needed
    # * Verbalises Queries by iteratively choosing a Step and expanding readings
    #
    # The verbalisation context consists of a set of Players, each for one ObjectType.
    # There may be more than one Player for the same ObjectType. If adjectives or role
    # names don't make such duplicates unambiguous, subscripts will be generated.
    # Thus, the verbalisation context must be completely populated before subscript
    # generation, which must be before any Player name gets verbalised.
    #
    # When a Player occurs in a Query, it corresponds to one Variable of that Query.
    # Each such Player has one or more Plays, which refer to roles played by
    # that ObjectType. Where a query traverses two roles of a ternary fact type, there
    # will be a residual node that has only a single Play with no other meaning.
    # A Play must be for exactly one Player, so is used to identify a Player.
    #
    # When a Player occurs outside a Query, it's identified by a projected RoleRef.
    # REVISIT: This is untrue when a uniqueness constraint is imported from NORMA.
    # In this case no query will be constructed to project the roles of the constrained
    # object type (only the constrained roles will be projected) - this will be fixed.
    #
    # Each constraint (except Ring Constraints) has one or more RoleSequence containing
    # the projected RoleRefs. Each constrained RoleSequence may have an associated Query.
    # If it has a Query, each RoleRef is projected from a Play, otherwise none are.
    #
    # The only type of query possible in a Ring Constraint is a subtyping query, which
    # is always implicit and unambiguous, so is never instantiated.
    #
    # A constrained RoleSequence that has no explicit Query may have an implicit query,
    # as per ORM2, when the roles aren't in the same fact type.  These implicit queries
    # are over only one ObjectType, by traversing a single FactType (and possibly,
    # multiple TypeInheritance FactTypes) for each RoleRef. Note however that when
    # the ObjectType is an objectified Fact Type, the FactType traversed might be a
    # phantom of the objectification. In the case of implicit queries, each Player is
    # identified by the projected RoleRef, except for the joined-over ObjectType whose
    # Player is... well, read the next paragraph!
    #
    # REVISIT: I believe that the foregoing paragraph is out of date, except with
    # respect to PresenceConstraints imported from NORMA (both external mandatory
    # and external uniqueness constraints). The joined-over Player in a UC is
    # identified by its RoleRefs in the RoleSequence of the Fact Type's preferred
    # reading. Subtyping steps in a mandatory constraint will probably malfunction.
    # However, all other such queries are explicit, and these should be also.
    #
    # For a SetComparisonConstraint, there are two or more constrained RoleSequences.
    # The matching RoleRefs (by Ordinal position) are for joined players, that is,
    # one individual instance plays both roles. The RoleRefs must (now) be for the
    # same ObjectType (no implicit subtyping step is allowed). Instead, the input modules
    # find the closest common supertype and create explicit Steps so its roles
    # can be projected.
    #
    # When expanding Reading text however, the RoleRefs in the reading's RoleSequence
    # may be expected not to be attached to the Players for that reading. Instead,
    # the set of one or more RoleRefs which caused that reading to be expanded must
    # be passed in, and the corresponding roles matched with Players to determine
    # the need to emit a subscript.
